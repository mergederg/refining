            <p><Strong>Refining: </Strong>Product owner/project management and devs reviewing upcoming work for
                do-ability and assigning
                estimates on time or complexity via voting.</p>

            <h2 data-id="title">Why do it?</h2>
            <p>Ensure the board/backlog/task list (whatever we want to call the set of things developers pull from in
                their day to day activities) remains populated with items that are <em>relevant</em>, <em>detailed</em>,
                <em>actionable</em> and <em>roughly estimated</em>.</p>

            <h2 data-id="title">Why do it?</h2>
            <p>The feedback cycle at development is far longer than it can be in refining meetings, so person-hours
                stand to be saved by shifting those conversations there prior to them ever becoming dev assignments.
                Remember the graph from last time!</p>

            <h2 data-id="title">Why do it?</h2>
            <p>Apart from improving ticket quality, this process also produces estimates (as time or complexity,
                according to org preferences) out of the process for 'free', doing away with the need for the "how long
                will this take?" phase many of our tickets go through upon first landing on a dev's board.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Anyone can put new tickets in the backlog to be refined for a round of development.</li>
                <li>Once the list of tickets is complete, a refining meeting allowing for ~3-5 minutes per ticket is
                    scheduled.
                </li>
                <li>Developers check this list and take a look at the areas of code, data models and plugins in question
                    to be able to make an informed estimate on it. They also review the proposed tickets for ambiguity
                    and unmet dependencies.

                <ul>
                    <li>Tickets are reviewed and pointed one by one.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Reading the ticket</em>: Hopefully people have already done this.</li>
                        <li><em>Discussion</em>: Developers raise any issues with the ticket or questions they have
                            about the task. If dependencies are unmet (for example, calling for setup ), enablement
                            tickets for those dependencies have to be created and executed first prior to the ticket
                            under discussion being actionable.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>Pointing/Estimating</em>: Once no questions are outstanding on a ticket, developers vote
                            (<a href="https://www.planningpoker.com/" target="_blank">planning poker</a> or physical
                            cards) on an estimate. Different strategies exist as to what this number represents and how
                            it is rendered down to one estimate -- some teams take the highest, some take the lowest,
                            others take the mean, median or mode, but the important thing is that its an informed
                            decision made by the development group on a now-refined ticket with as full a transfer of
                            requirements as possible from stakeholders.
